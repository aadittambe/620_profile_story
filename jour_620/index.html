        <p>A Google search for Reading, Pa., returns image results that make it blend in with many American working-class towns &mdash; a vibrant downtown with a few skyscrapers, public parks, and a couple of tourist attractions.</p>

        <p>The town sits in Berks County, which is predominantly white Anglo-Saxon and is known to be a part of the Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Reading&rsquo;s population of approximately 90,000 people, however, is not reflective Berks County&rsquo;s demographics. Latin American immigrants comprise nearly half of the town&rsquo;s population.</p>
        
        <p>Roc&iacute;o Fregoso-Mota&rsquo;s family moved from Mexico to Reading in search of work &mdash; and a better life. Fregoso-Mota was born in Reading, which made her a U.S. citizen. However, her family members were undocumented. She learned from an early to never openly discuss their true identities &mdash; such as their place of birth or legal status. Immigration law had a direct impact on her family &mdash; growing up, it played an important role in shaping her identity.</p>

        <p>The 29-year-old was appointed the coordinator for Immigrant and Undocumented Student Life at the University of Maryland in October, a role in which she hopes to further inclusion and engagement efforts and help immigrant and undocumented students navigate their academic and social life at the university.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I have commonalities with certain experiences that they might have,&rdquo; Fregoso-Mota said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an intersection there that exists &mdash; and this role is a combination of everything I&rsquo;ve done and wanted to do. This is a story of my own.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>Fregoso-Mota attended Thomas Jefferson University, where she studied law and biopsychology. After graduation, she moved to Los Angeles to work for a nonprofit that helped immigrants and marginalized populations find employment.</p>
        
        <p>Working as a resident assistant in college, she said, she knew she wanted to work in higher education. So, she returned to her hometown and worked at Alvernia University, where she guided undocumented students from local high schools to apply for scholarships and guided students protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.</p>
        
        <p>She then moved to D.C., where she worked at the Catholic University of America as a counselor for Latinx students and helped establish inclusion and engagement initiatives. In March 2019, she joined the University of Maryland School of Public Policy as a student affairs coordinator.</p>
        
        <p>She was most passionate about working with students with immigrant backgrounds and advocating for undocumented students, drawing inspiration from her own background &mdash; to relate those experiences to create an inclusive environment.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I may experience immigration one way as a citizen, but I still have family (members), who are not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And as a family, we&rsquo;re very much attuned to how immigration policy affects our own family; and within that, particularly specific family members (who are undocumented).&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>In her new role, she said, her priority is leading trust-building efforts. Undocumented students often don&rsquo;t know whom to trust and share their story with &mdash; they hit roadblocks in higher education because of this lack of trust.</p>
        
        <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=12EVZk7Jt5XLtkaoz_tgp2IsExRLN4-tw04BvagP0_kM&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650px' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>

        <p>Residency reclassification, she said, is particularly difficult for undocumented students. Students who generally fall under the DACA status or Temporary Protection Status are generally billed as international students.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;But for most of them, they&rsquo;ve gone to school here; their family is here&#8230; they&rsquo;re not international students in the traditional sense at all,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The experiences they&rsquo;ve had are American experiences and identify with American students.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>She hopes to work across departments &mdash; such as financial aid, registrar&rsquo;s office, housing and dining &mdash; to make sure students don&rsquo;t have to disclose their immigration status if they feel uncomfortable, she said.</p>
        
        <p>Now, more than ever, our society understands what it means to be undocumented, she said. At the same time, undocumented students are faced with more barriers &mdash; from legal complications to racism.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;A lot of people have been here for a long time and they have invested in this country and have roots in this country, and they very much want to be a part of the community... They want to experience what it&rsquo;s like to (not have) as many barriers,&rdquo; she said.   Fregoso-Mota said the university intentionally does not maintain lists or data regarding how many undocumented students are enrolled.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;If you think about documents that can be requested from us to other people&#8230; it just really isn't the safest practice,&rdquo; she said.</p>
        
        <p>A report published by Inside Higher Ed estimated the number of undocumented students enrolled in U.S. higher education institutions to be 454,000. The report found that approximately half of all undocumented students were eligible for DACA.</p>
        
        <p>Fregoso-Mota&rsquo;s role is not a new one for the university, although the position of coordinator for undocumented students went from a temporary one to a permanent position when she was hired, said Cori Carfagno, assistant director for engagement at the Stamp Student Union, said. The university started the search process in April, which ended in August.</p>
        
        <p>She has a personal connection with the community, Carfagno said. She knows what it&rsquo;s like to live and learn as an immigrant student.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;Roc&iacute;o is a community builder,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our office&rsquo;s role and mission are to be those builders of community &mdash; connecting students &mdash; and already in the last three or four weeks, I&rsquo;ve seen her make strides to connect with students to get to know them, and other departments as well.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>It&rsquo;s not only important to help undocumented students &ldquo;transition in,&rdquo; Carfagno said, but also to &ldquo;transition them out.&rdquo; This means helping them with seeking employment and making sure various departments on campus are aware of what their immigration status means. Fregoso-Mota understands immigration laws and will be able to advocate for students, she said.</p>
        
        <p>Being raised in mixed-status family, in Reading &mdash; a town with a high immigrant population, Fregoso-Mota said, she has closely seen undocumented immigrants navigate their social and legal journeys in the U.S. She understands the needs of students and how they can be best served.</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;With this role, hopefully, I&rsquo;ll be able to say to students, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s someone here to support you and create a sense of belonging,&rsquo;&rdquo; Fregoso-Mota said.</p>
